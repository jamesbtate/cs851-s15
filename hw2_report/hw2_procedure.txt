deleted 430 files that were downloaded in hw1 that were audio files, not html. they were 11.6GB of podcasts

got popular URIs using new summary.py option

opened 200 most popular URIs in chrome to manually cull crap webpages

used below for loop to index popular URIs
    c=0; for i in $(cat popular_tweets_pruned); do c=$(( c + 1 )); echo "$c $i"; done > popular_tweets_pruned_ids

downloaded using wget_warc.bash

used grep -L "200 OK" warc/wget/*.wget.output to find indexes of URIs that are no good

to find warcs that are present for multiple methods:
    comm -1 -2 <(ls warcreate-warcs/ | cut -d. -f1 | sort) <(ls webrecorder-warcs/ | cut -d. -f1 | sort)

to run SOLR:
    cd warc-solr-test-server/
    PATH=$PATH:/home/jtate/src/apache-maven-3.2.5/bin/ mvn jetty:run-exploded -Djetty.port=10770
to add WARCs to SOLR:
    java -jar warc-indexer-2.0.1-20150116.110435-2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -s http://localhost:10770/discovery -t ../../cs751/warc/wget/*.warc.gz

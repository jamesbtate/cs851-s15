The question became a hashtag, the hashtag became a police matter, and the answer, eventually, turned out to be relatively simple.Here is what happened. On Tuesday, as the snow and wind battered Boston and much of New England, someone posted a photo of a person at the Boston Marathon’s finish line.Love that Dirty Frozen Water #Boston #bostonblizzard #BostonStrong pic.twitter.com/BDaI2m1z0C— Philip L. Hillman (@PhillyIdol1017) January 27, 2015This made its way around the Internet, as things do, and various news organizations (ahem) jumped on the chance to talk about this positive enigma.A hashtag soon followed: #WhoShoveledTheFinishLine, people wondered? If they tweeted enough, could they find this man or woman?How amazing is this? Someone shoveled the Finish Line of the Boston Marathon. #BostonStrong #WhoShoveledTheFinishLine pic.twitter.com/3BFul8nJ3j— Chris Gibilisco (@Sinatra1979) January 28, 2015So who DID shovel the Boston Marathon finish line? #whoshoveledthefinishline http://t.co/jhBbYEmxl8— Deb Filcman (@DebFilcman) January 28, 2015The Boston Police Department got involved:Help Boston solve a #BlizzardOf2015 mystery. #WhoShoveledTheFinishLine? #BostonStrong pic.twitter.com/1icgPcW9Vc— Boston Police Dept. (@bostonpolice) January 28, 2015On Wednesday, the mystery was solved and someone was identified as the unknown shoveler who had so enthralled a frigid, snowed-out region.The manager of the Back Bay Social Club said he saw people tweeting about the photo and the mysterious person — only to recognize the shoveler and the shovel.“I was like, ‘Oh shoot, that was Chris!” Ryan Swann, manager of the restaurant, said in a telephone interview.Christopher Laudani, who has tended bar at the place for about six months, was helping shovel outside the restaurant on Tuesday, because it remained open during the snowstorm.After shoveling for a while, Laudani asked if he could borrow the restaurant’s shovel, Swann said. Laudani took the shovel and disappeared for a while. When he was asked later where he went, he said he was clearing off the marathon finish line.The result is a lot of praise for Laudani and a lot of calls for the restaurant. “I’m no hero, I’m just a nut who loves the marathon,” Laudani told Boston magazine.So what is next for Laudani after a day as the subject of a viral enigma, yet another person unexpectedly thrust to some measure of notoriety because of Twitter or Facebook (and for positive reasons, rather than for some good, old-fashioned, crowdsourced Twitter shaming)? He will be right back where he was when the snow hit. He’s scheduled to work on Wednesday night.Mark Berman is a reporter on the National staff.

More revenue is also being put into this \"hobby\" so they'll announce more than a few cities next time.permalinkparent[–]SmiteTheeWithAFish 10 points11 points12 points 15 days ago (13 children)Don't forget that partnership with SpaceX, to launch about 4,000 internet satellites, for a global connection alternative.permalinkparent[–]chrisms150 2 points3 points4 points 15 days ago (11 children)Which, while interesting, would have horrible latency times. So the only people interested in that would be people who don't game, or use their connection for video conferencing into an office or something like that.It would at least cut off some cash flow to the cable companies of users who don't need low pings though.permalinkparent[–]kaibee 1 point2 points3 points 15 days ago (1 child)Actually the plan is to put them in near earth orbit so the latency times wouldn't be horrible. (something like 60-120ms)permalinkparent[–]chrisms150 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)Hmm, 60 is reasonable, but 120 would make gaming unplayable. At least those delays would make average home users fine though so hopefully it'l force the ISPS to actually compete and be better.permalinkparent[–]SmiteTheeWithAFish 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago* (0 children)Only according to how high up the satellites are.Keep in mind, satellite latency is a four way trip. Your request goes up, then down, then the answer goes up, then down. As well as wherever it bounces around, normally.If they put the satellites up around 500 miles up, like GPS satellites, that's 'normal' + 2000 miles, or about 100ms additional lag.While that would be murder on a video game, it would be relatively benign for typical internet use.I should underscore that they are NOT putting all of these up in geosynchronous orbit. Parking up there is extremely limited. You'll just be connected to whatever satellites are overhead, and connect to additional ones as they move along. Sort of like driving and talking on the phone connects to different cellular towers.Of course, most of the time, they won't be directly overhead. So add some variable ping time for them, according to their relative locations to you, over time.permalinkparent[–]SmiteTheeWithAFish 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago* (6 children)Another thing you're overlooking is co-hosting+mirroring content on the satellites. I wonder how much SSD storage you could launch with each of them? I'm thinking: LOTS.That would be a 25ms ping time (give or take) from surface to satellite, at 500 miles up. That's better than anything I can get from my cable internet or from a cell phone.The English Wikipedia, images and all a little less than 50GB, as a ZIM. You can download/torrent it. (You should, too). Sure, it's bigger, stored as a mirror, and it does come in many languages, but the content could be mirrored across the constellation of satellites. Trivially. There are other, similar repositories of knowledge that could be cohosted and mirrored on all of the satellites. The Project Gutenberg ZIM is also about the same size. You should download it, too.Common web libraries, fonts, etc., could all be cohosted, to speed up load times.As a revenue source, you could charge companies to mirror their content on it. News sites could cache content on the satellites, and refresh several times a day. Most web sites have a fuck-ton of relatively invariant content and assets, before you get to the meat of their offerings, and for the majority, that 'meat' doesn't really change that much, either.Even if there were a global catastrophe, like an all-out nuclear war, most of these satellites would still be up there, working. Wouldn't it be nice, if they had useful content to serve up? Like wikipedia articles on water purification? How to make batteries? Even the 'old', non-copyrighted Project Gutenberg content preserves content on making things from scratch.permalinkparent[–]chrisms150 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (5 children)Hi; I feel like you didn't read my post at all from what you just said.permalinkparent[–]SmiteTheeWithAFish 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (4 children)You claimed 'horrible latency times'.25ms is not 'horrible'.permalinkparent[–]chrisms150 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (3 children)Again, please reread my post. Your 25ms is one trip. Not four. So the true latency would be 50ms if the data was on a satellite. And, if you read my post, I specifically said this would be no-go for games/teleconferencing.Both of which are not scenarios your post addresses at all.permalinkparent[–]SmiteTheeWithAFish 0 points158121 point2 points 14 days ago (2 children)You're right and wrong. It's 50ms, up and down, since the satellite had the content mirrored, locally.As in, it didn't have to bounce all over space and the internet, to find a terrestrial server farm. It's got a copy of the same shit ON THAT SATELLITE, to send back.http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/mirror_site.htmlIn other words, your browser asks for: http://allthefonts/some_big_font.woffThe satellite has 'http://allthefonts/some_big_font.woff' in its local cache.It sends its own, mirrored copy to your browser, without involving the rest of the internet, as if it came from there.permalinkparent[–]chrisms150 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (1 child)What are you on about dude. I just said - that it is 50ms assuming the satellite has the data on it. Literally just said that exactly.

Very likely it will in future though.permalinkparent[–]Throwahoymatie 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)That would be funny if they announced 8 cities next. The cable companies would catch the pattern and piss themselves.permalinkparent[–]UptownDonkey 2 points3 points4 points 15 days ago (0 children)just a few cities a yearGoogle already missed their opportunity to seriously compete with cable companies because of this. That was probably never their goal of course but if they had done an aggressive roll out 3-5 years ago they would have had a major competitive advantage. With all the major cable companies on track to start deploying DOCSIS 3.1 later this year it's very likely cable will have more gigabit data subscribers than Google Fiber even by the end of 2015. It's basically the same situation that happened with Verizon FIOS. They couldn't build out fast enough and pickup enough subscribers to make the numbers work. When cable companies started DOCSIS 3 deployments plus deep discounting in competitive markets Verizon actually lost subscribers.permalinkparent[–]The_sad_zebra 20 points21 points22 points 15 days ago (1 child)They should put some in Philadelphia, Comcast's home city.permalink[–]Sybs 5 points6 points7 points 15 days ago (0 children)Maybe not wise to try eating the prey before you've killed it.permalinkparent[–]ReverendDexter 10 points11 points12 points 16 days ago (9 children)If Google would come to the North Bay, I'd scrap Comcast as fast as their customer service would let me. I'd pay more for Google Fiber than I currently overpay to Comcast just to have an actual fast, actually reliable service.permalink[–]j_schmotzenberg 3 points4 points5 points 15 days ago (1 child)Try Sonic.netpermalinkparent[–]ReverendDexter 2 points3 points4 points 15 days ago (0 children)I have :( I'm at the very end of the run, max speed is about double dial-up, and the connection drops out every 5-10 minutes. Even the sonic employees in the neighborhood don't use the free sonic service they can get.permalinkparent[+]PostNationalism comment score below threshold-7 points-6 points-5 points 16 days ago (6 children)If Google covered the nation in fiber they'd have all the same problems Comcast is having..permalinkparent[–]12345768 7 points8 points9 points 16 days ago (1 child)Comcast is a Frankenstein network from buying up companies, Google wouldn't have that problem.permalinkparent[–]MacGuffin1 1 point2 points3 points 15 days ago (0 children)Google bought the Provo system that was built by Provo city and managed/retailed by third parties. I'm not disagreeing with you, just wanted to add clarifying information if we're drawing a comparison.permalinkparent[–]SvenSvensen 1 point2 points3 points 15 days ago (0 children)Just so we're clear on this: Comcast is not having any technical problems. They are perfectly capable of providing better service but they choose not to in any city where they have no competition.permalinkparent[–]ReverendDexter 7 points8 points9 points 16 days ago (2 children)Sure. Google's not some magical fantasy do-gooder, they're the new kid on the block and they have to provide reason for people to switch. When they're the big established company with the majority of market share, they don't have to do that.Right now, Google WILL provide better service than Comcast becasue they have to. Should Google become the monopoly player, then we can move on to the next upcomer who's using better service to bait us away.It's not about Google vs Comcast, it's about new player in a damn near monopoly market.permalinkparent[–]DZCreeper 8 points9 points10 points 15 days ago (1 child)Google would never be as bad as Comcast. Their an internet company. They make revenue from people having fast and reliable internet connections.permalinkparent[–]bartturner 3 points4 points5 points 15 days ago (0 children)Totally agree. The incentive for Google is completely different than Comcast. There is much better alignmentpermalinkparent[–]digitrix 3 points4 points5 points 16 days ago (4 children)Sucks that it will probably never come to WA.

They're willing to put in a small amount of their money to try to tease the market into action, but not really wanting to go full in. It's a bit similar to trolling. (Congrats to those in the selected markets though!)permalinkparent[–]Carocrazy132 -2 points-1 points0 points 16 days ago (0 children)Google is an awesome crafty company who doesn't wanna be targeted.

This is one of the critical problems with the existing ISPs.permalink[–]WStHappenings 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)Another really interesting side-benefit of installing fiber and running it is that Google becomes a vertically integrated business - they own the search, they own the ads, and they own the wire (or fiber) you used to get to the search and the ads.Who knows if they'd do it (IMHO they would be stupid not to, morals excepted), but it means their data centers can access your bits as they fly across the wire - meaning they can collect all sorts of interesting user habits based on your browsing (data is big money) and they won't even have the \"who is this user IRL?\" problems since they'll have an account holder's physical name/address for each fiber account.permalink[–]coldincanada 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (0 children)Are they going to use this one weird old trick that moms in your area know about but is going to be banned?!permalink[–]Ev3nt 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (2 children)Come on do some major cities already, especially NYC to give Time Warner a kick in the ass for its crap overpriced garbage service.permalink[–]Iced-Dragonhide 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago (0 children)Yes, please.permalinkparent[–]mike7654 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago (1 child)If google installed fiber on Uranus I bet most redditors would visit if not make a colonypermalink[–]Dwansumfauk 2 points3 points4 points 15 days ago (0 children)I don't know, the latency to Earth would be too much to game on, but the download speed would be really tempting.permalinkparent[–]infotheist -1 points0 points1 point 15 days ago (1 child)Why are they taking so fucking long? Seriously. It seems like Google Fiber has been rolling out for at least 2-4 years now.permalink[–]Moses89 1 point2 points3 points 15 days ago (0 children)Because they have to tear up streets and yards to install the fiber. They also have to work with cities to get everything in order legally which takes awhile. It's also why Google is so invested in trying to get rid of state laws that prohibit them from expanding into areas that don't already have some basic fiber networks already in place.permalinkparentaboutblogaboutteamsource codeadvertisejobshelpwikiFAQreddiquetterulescontact ustoolsmobilefirefox extensionchrome extensionbuttonswidget<3reddit goldstoreredditgiftsreddit AMA appreddit.tvradio redditUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (updated) and Privacy Policy (updated). © 2015 reddit inc.

(arrow) keys to browse more storiesvia Carl Bruere1.4MReads379CommentsEaston Bruere should be having the time of his life right now.He just finished his senior season as quarterback at Rio Rancho (New Mexico) High School by leading it to a 13-0 record and a 6A state title. According to MaxPreps, Easton threw for 4,567 yards and 49 touchdowns with only six interceptions this season. In the process, he became the state's all-time leader in passing yards.Easton should be getting ready to enjoy his final semester of high school before heading off to college to resume his playing career. But there's one small problem.He has zero scholarship offers less than a week before national signing day.How could he find himself in this situation?The primary reasons for his present circumstances are largely beyond his control. Given that he checks in at 6'3\", 200 pounds—measurements that place him bigger or equal to 24 of the nation's top 50 pro-style passers in the 2015 class—his measurables aren't an issue like they were for Desmon White last year.According to his father, Carl, Easton attended numerous camps—including those held at schools in the Big Ten, Big 12, Mountain West and the Pac-12—prior to his senior season.\"They've all really loved him,\" Carl told Bleacher Report. \"They showed him a lot of love when he visited. They thought he had great size and a good arm and things of that nature. They all said he's definitely a Division I quarterback.\" Carl said that at first, Easton would get excited when mail would arrive from colleges. That joy faded over time, when he realized there was nothing of substance enclosed. \"He's got tons of letters,\" Carl said. \"It's funny, because he stopped opening them because he knew it was filler mail. He got letters from 20 or 30 colleges, and once in a while, there would be a handwritten letter from a coach. But it's really strange, because they came from places all over the country. But he knew what they were. He was excited at first. But then, it's like, 'OK, I know what this is.'\"Credit: Carl BruereThere aren't any off-field concerns for schools to ponder, either.Easton is carrying a 4.0 GPA during his senior year and has a cumulative average of 3.75. He and Carl—who doubles as the offensive coordinator at Rio Rancho—have started a quarterback camp designed to mentor younger kids in his hometown. It certainly can't be because of his performance.En route to winning the state title, Easton outdueled 4-star quarterback, fellow New Mexico native and Michigan commitment Zach Gentry by throwing for 554 yards and three touchdowns in a 64-43 win over El Dorado in the state semifinals, according to James Yodice of the Albuquerque Journal. He plays in his state's biggest classification, and his team has beaten teams from Arizona and West Texas during his high school career. The answer to his conundrum has several layers, starting with his home state.ShareTweetNew Mexico's state nickname is The Land of Enchantment. However, for college recruiters, the entire state might as well be Area 51.Since 2005, the state has produced just four players who have earned a 4-star rating and another 11 who were ranked as 3-stars by 247Sports. In the same time frame, only six quarterbacks from New Mexico earned a star rating.Only two prospects from New Mexico have been rated a 3-star or better in the 2015 cycle—with Gentry being one of them. With the perceived lack of talent in the state, players such as Easton are grossly underexposed when compared with prospects from other states.\"I think being in New Mexico has hurt him, because there are so many players elsewhere and not enough here,\" Carl said. \"For instance, Texas or Ohio State or any school can go to one little area in Texas where there are 20 or 30 prospects in the same place. Whereas in New Mexico, you're only really looking at one or two players, so they don't really come out here a lot.\" Breaking: Easton Bruere is named New Mexico Mr. Football by @nmpreps https://t.co/uTGnOgqg8l pic.twitter.com/QiU75BQOWx— Kyle Henderson (@nmpreps) December 15, 2014Brandon Darlington, who just finished up his first year as the offensive line coach at Rio Rancho, grew up in Pennsylvania and played college football at Syracuse from 2002-06. \"When (my wife and I) first came out here, to find out how big football really is out here, and how popular it is, it was kind of a culture shock, actually,\" Darlington said.He notes that he was also shocked at the quality of the competition Rio Rancho faced.\"It's not like we're playing against crappy opponents,\" Darlington said. \"We're playing against West Texas teams. We're playing schools like Mayfield and Las Cruces and so on. Teams that have been putting up big-time numbers and putting people in Division I schools for years.\"During the spring evaluation period, Carl said that coaches from Tulsa and Iowa State were the only programs who stopped by Rio Rancho, a town of nearly 100,000 people just north of Albuquerque. \"In order for us to get seen, we have to go out and go to these camps,\" Easton said. \"No colleges usually come to New Mexico. It's kind of funny, because we've beaten teams like Notre Dame Prep and Salpointe from Arizona that have guys going Division I all the time.\" If a player from New Mexico gets noticed, it's usually because he's the no-brainer type coaches simply can't refuse.For example, Gentry—who is friends with Easton—is 6'7\", 240 pounds with a 4.6-second time in the 40-yard dash.His measurables alone would be enough to generate college interest. The fact that he's been productive helped him avoid the fate of other talented players from New Mexico who weren't as physically gifted.Kyle Henderson, who has covered high school football in New Mexico for the last decade and runs NMPreps.com (part of the Rivals network) shares a similar sentiment. \"Zach Gentry was hard to put on the map, honestly,\" Henderson said. \"If he wasn't 6'7\", 240, I don't know if he'd have the offers that he has now.\"Henderson witnessed the duel between El Dorado and Rio Rancho live and said it didn't take long to know he was watching something special between the two stud passers.\"It was back-and-forth with two heavyweights going at it,\" Henderson said. \"I wouldn't say that Easton completely outshined Zach, but it was clear that these two were something that we will probably never see again in New Mexico. It was that good of a matchup.\"Living in an area that has historically been neglected by colleges is a burden that Easton admits he's pondered.\"From day one, I told my dad, 'I wish we didn't live in New Mexico because of this recruiting thing,'\" Easton said as he replayed those conversations in his mind. \"'No one comes to New Mexico. No one looks at New Mexico kids.' Then you look at the picture like, what else do these college coaches want me to do?\" Credit: Carl BruereUpon viewing Easton in his first few practices at his new home, Darlington's first thought was to ask to see which school he was committed to.Utterly befuddled at the news that he had yet to receive an offer, he took matters into his own hands.\"From the day I took the job and started coaching, I've just been posting his highlights and statistics on people's Facebook,\" Darlington said. \"Whether they are GAs at colleges or they coach at other colleges. I'd be like, 'Hey, take a look at this kid,' or 'What do you think?'\"Darlington received positive feedback on Easton from several of his coaching friends scattered throughout the country.\"One coach at a Pac-12 school said that he liked Easton, but he already had commitments at quarterback for the next two years.\"According to Darlington, that particular coach noted that the unusually deep 2015 quarterback class in California allowed most schools to focus their efforts in territories they were already familiar with.Carl and Easton also took matters into their own hands in the quest to net a scholarship offer.They sent out film to every FBS school and several FCS and Division II programs. They even researched schools and their recruiting classes to see which schools still had openings and needs at quarterback. \"We kept up with his stats weekly and sent that out with his Hudl film on a weekly basis,\" Carl said. \"We researched it and came up with a group of about 30 colleges that publicly have not gotten their 2015 quarterback yet, and we sent stuff out to them every week, his film and stats.\"Anyone looking for a 6'3\" QB with 49 TD passes, 4,100 yards and only 3 INTs this season? Anyone? #EastonBruere http://t.co/tILVeilDjp— Chad Wilson (@GridironStuds) December 2, 2014Recruiting is never final until a player enrolls or signs a national letter of intent, so Carl also mass-emailed every FBS school in the country in case an opening suddenly materialized. The rest of the staff at Rio Rancho also tried to use its network to get the word out on its star quarterback.\"Some of our coaches have some connections, and they've been talking to other coaches for me and things like that,\" Easton said. \"I've been in a couple of magazines, Sports Illustrated being one of them. We've done a lot of things.\" Congratulations to rio rancho's Easton bruere for making the Faces on the Crowd section of sports illustrated pic.twitter.com/M25OetLgOK— J.P. Murrieta (@KOBSports) November 29, 2014While it's not a complete shock that colleges outside the state aren't beating down the doors of the Bruere residence, the fact that in-state programs New Mexico and New Mexico State have shunned the state's most prolific prep passer is peculiar.For the record, the Lobos received a commitment from 3-star JUCO passer Austin Apodaca in December. The Aggies have yet to secure a verbal pledge from a quarterback in the 2015 cycle, perhaps due to the fact they signed six quarterbacks in the 2014 cycle.\"It baffles me that the home schools don't even offer him, and they're 20 minutes down the road,\" Darlington said.As fate would have it, both schools who came to view Easton live in the spring were heavily interested in him.In fact, the coach from Tulsa hinted to staff members at Rio Rancho that an offer would be coming—one that Carl said Easton was prepared to accept.Their long journey would finally have a happy ending.Instead, a bitter dose of reality intervened.\"It was a Monday when he (Tulsa coach) was here. I guess they saw someone else later that week that they liked better and reneged on that, which was kind of disappointing because we let the cat out and said that Easton was going to commit because he loved Tulsa. That was kind of heartbreaking.\"He was on the Cyclones board as well, but they secured a commitment from their top target, which ended their pursuit of him.The same could be said for Michigan State, where Easton enjoyed working with Spartans quarterback coach Brad Salem during a summer camp session.\"He's a great guy,\" Carl said. \"He already had his offer for 2015, but we had a great experience going there. He was high on Easton, and he still keeps in touch with him.\"RT this: #recruitEastonBruere— Kyle Henderson (@nmpreps) November 29, 2014Despite the disappointments piling up heading into the season, Easton hasn't let the uncertainty surrounding his future affect him whether on or off the field.Instead, he brushed it aside and delivered a nearly flawless senior campaign on the field.He was a solid starter in each of his sophomore and junior seasons but elevated his game to another level as a senior.Entering this season, he had thrown 59 touchdown passes in the previous two seasons while completing nearly 67 percent of his passes. This year, he nearly doubled his total in scoring strikes and raised his completion rate to an astounding 75 percent. Henderson notes that Rio Rancho had never won a state title prior to this season despite being on the cusp of that elusive championship for many years. Easton focused his attention on accomplishing that goal and had to topple Gentry and Mayfield's Kavika Johnson—a quarterback with offers from BYU, UTEP, New Mexico and New Mexico State—to do it. \"Since he didn't get recruited and since he doesn't have any offers, it was almost like he had a chip on his shoulder, and he went out there every game like he had something to prove,\" Henderson said. \"He carried that with him, and I think it elevated his game. They went through a gauntlet in the playoffs and beat a very good team in the state title game.\"However, Easton admits it's been hard to keep a positive attitude at times given his recruitment struggles.\"It gets to me at times,\" Easton said. \"That's just laying in bed at night sometimes and thinking about it. I was able to play for a unique group this year. I spent a ton of time with them, and that kept my mind off recruiting, because we were always just having a ball playing football.\"His attitude in dealing with the snub from colleges reminds Carl of how his son puts away his mistakes on the field—one of the attributes he said helps Easton stand out in a loaded 2015 class of quarterbacks.\"It's funny, because he's amazing in how he's handling all of this,\" Carl said. \"All he says is, 'Dad, I want to go where someone wants me.' That's all he cares about. 'I don't care where it is, as long as they want me and I can help them win.' He just wants to go to a place that wants him there. I don't know how he does it. Because it's killing his father.\" Only a handful of prep football players are fortunate enough to earn scholarship offers to continue their careers in college. There's nothing in Easton Bruere's resume that suggests he shouldn't be one of them.In fact, his body of work suggests he's the nation's most accomplished player in the 2015 class without a scholarship offer.\"In New Mexico, we don't get a lot of notoriety for our football prospects,\" Henderson said. \"We get it. But for someone to put a 13-0 season together at the highest level, with his numbers, that's something noteworthy. There has to be some place out there, Division I-wise, that you'd think this guy can fit into.

(arrow) keys to browse more storiesvia Carl Bruere1.4MReads379CommentsEaston Bruere should be having the time of his life right now.He just finished his senior season as quarterback at Rio Rancho (New Mexico) High School by leading it to a 13-0 record and a 6A state title. According to MaxPreps, Easton threw for 4,567 yards and 49 touchdowns with only six interceptions this season. In the process, he became the state's all-time leader in passing yards.Easton should be getting ready to enjoy his final semester of high school before heading off to college to resume his playing career. But there's one small problem.He has zero scholarship offers less than a week before national signing day.How could he find himself in this situation?The primary reasons for his present circumstances are largely beyond his control. Given that he checks in at 6'3\", 200 pounds—measurements that place him bigger or equal to 24 of the nation's top 50 pro-style passers in the 2015 class—his measurables aren't an issue like they were for Desmon White last year.According to his father, Carl, Easton attended numerous camps—including those held at schools in the Big Ten, Big 12, Mountain West and the Pac-12—prior to his senior season.\"They've all really loved him,\" Carl told Bleacher Report. \"They showed him a lot of love when he visited. They thought he had great size and a good arm and things of that nature. They all said he's definitely a Division I quarterback.\" Carl said that at first, Easton would get excited when mail would arrive from colleges. That joy faded over time, when he realized there was nothing of substance enclosed. \"He's got tons of letters,\" Carl said. \"It's funny, because he stopped opening them because he knew it was filler mail. He got letters from 20 or 30 colleges, and once in a while, there would be a handwritten letter from a coach. But it's really strange, because they came from places all over the country. But he knew what they were. He was excited at first. But then, it's like, 'OK, I know what this is.'\"Credit: Carl BruereThere aren't any off-field concerns for schools to ponder, either.Easton is carrying a 4.0 GPA during his senior year and has a cumulative average of 3.75. He and Carl—who doubles as the offensive coordinator at Rio Rancho—have started a quarterback camp designed to mentor younger kids in his hometown. It certainly can't be because of his performance.En route to winning the state title, Easton outdueled 4-star quarterback, fellow New Mexico native and Michigan commitment Zach Gentry by throwing for 554 yards and three touchdowns in a 64-43 win over El Dorado in the state semifinals, according to James Yodice of the Albuquerque Journal. He plays in his state's biggest classification, and his team has beaten teams from Arizona and West Texas during his high school career. The answer to his conundrum has several layers, starting with his home state.ShareTweetNew Mexico's state nickname is The Land of Enchantment. However, for college recruiters, the entire state might as well be Area 51.Since 2005, the state has produced just four players who have earned a 4-star rating and another 11 who were ranked as 3-stars by 247Sports. In the same time frame, only six quarterbacks from New Mexico earned a star rating.Only two prospects from New Mexico have been rated a 3-star or better in the 2015 cycle—with Gentry being one of them. With the perceived lack of talent in the state, players such as Easton are grossly underexposed when compared with prospects from other states.\"I think being in New Mexico has hurt him, because there are so many players elsewhere and not enough here,\" Carl said. \"For instance, Texas or Ohio State or any school can go to one little area in Texas where there are 20 or 30 prospects in the same place. Whereas in New Mexico, you're only really looking at one or two players, so they don't really come out here a lot.\" Breaking: Easton Bruere is named New Mexico Mr. Football by @nmpreps https://t.co/uTGnOgqg8l pic.twitter.com/QiU75BQOWx— Kyle Henderson (@nmpreps) December 15, 2014Brandon Darlington, who just finished up his first year as the offensive line coach at Rio Rancho, grew up in Pennsylvania and played college football at Syracuse from 2002-06. \"When (my wife and I) first came out here, to find out how big football really is out here, and how popular it is, it was kind of a culture shock, actually,\" Darlington said.He notes that he was also shocked at the quality of the competition Rio Rancho faced.\"It's not like we're playing against crappy opponents,\" Darlington said. \"We're playing against West Texas teams. We're playing schools like Mayfield and Las Cruces and so on. Teams that have been putting up big-time numbers and putting people in Division I schools for years.\"During the spring evaluation period, Carl said that coaches from Tulsa and Iowa State were the only programs who stopped by Rio Rancho, a town of nearly 100,000 people just north of Albuquerque. \"In order for us to get seen, we have to go out and go to these camps,\" Easton said. \"No colleges usually come to New Mexico. It's kind of funny, because we've beaten teams like Notre Dame Prep and Salpointe from Arizona that have guys going Division I all the time.\" If a player from New Mexico gets noticed, it's usually because he's the no-brainer type coaches simply can't refuse.For example, Gentry—who is friends with Easton—is 6'7\", 240 pounds with a 4.6-second time in the 40-yard dash.His measurables alone would be enough to generate college interest. The fact that he's been productive helped him avoid the fate of other talented players from New Mexico who weren't as physically gifted.Kyle Henderson, who has covered high school football in New Mexico for the last decade and runs NMPreps.com (part of the Rivals network) shares a similar sentiment. \"Zach Gentry was hard to put on the map, honestly,\" Henderson said. \"If he wasn't 6'7\", 240, I don't know if he'd have the offers that he has now.\"Henderson witnessed the duel between El Dorado and Rio Rancho live and said it didn't take long to know he was watching something special between the two stud passers.\"It was back-and-forth with two heavyweights going at it,\" Henderson said. \"I wouldn't say that Easton completely outshined Zach, but it was clear that these two were something that we will probably never see again in New Mexico. It was that good of a matchup.\"Living in an area that has historically been neglected by colleges is a burden that Easton admits he's pondered.\"From day one, I told my dad, 'I wish we didn't live in New Mexico because of this recruiting thing,'\" Easton said as he replayed those conversations in his mind. \"'No one comes to New Mexico. No one looks at New Mexico kids.' Then you look at the picture like, what else do these college coaches want me to do?\" Credit: Carl BruereUpon viewing Easton in his first few practices at his new home, Darlington's first thought was to ask to see which school he was committed to.Utterly befuddled at the news that he had yet to receive an offer, he took matters into his own hands.\"From the day I took the job and started coaching, I've just been posting his highlights and statistics on people's Facebook,\" Darlington said. \"Whether they are GAs at colleges or they coach at other colleges. I'd be like, 'Hey, take a look at this kid,' or 'What do you think?'\"Darlington received positive feedback on Easton from several of his coaching friends scattered throughout the country.\"One coach at a Pac-12 school said that he liked Easton, but he already had commitments at quarterback for the next two years.\"According to Darlington, that particular coach noted that the unusually deep 2015 quarterback class in California allowed most schools to focus their efforts in territories they were already familiar with.Carl and Easton also took matters into their own hands in the quest to net a scholarship offer.They sent out film to every FBS school and several FCS and Division II programs. They even researched schools and their recruiting classes to see which schools still had openings and needs at quarterback. \"We kept up with his stats weekly and sent that out with his Hudl film on a weekly basis,\" Carl said. \"We researched it and came up with a group of about 30 colleges that publicly have not gotten their 2015 quarterback yet, and we sent stuff out to them every week, his film and stats.\"Anyone looking for a 6'3\" QB with 49 TD passes, 4,100 yards and only 3 INTs this season? Anyone? #EastonBruere http://t.co/tILVeilDjp— Chad Wilson (@GridironStuds) December 2, 2014Recruiting is never final until a player enrolls or signs a national letter of intent, so Carl also mass-emailed every FBS school in the country in case an opening suddenly materialized. The rest of the staff at Rio Rancho also tried to use its network to get the word out on its star quarterback.\"Some of our coaches have some connections, and they've been talking to other coaches for me and things like that,\" Easton said. \"I've been in a couple of magazines, Sports Illustrated being one of them. We've done a lot of things.\" Congratulations to rio rancho's Easton bruere for making the Faces on the Crowd section of sports illustrated pic.twitter.com/M25OetLgOK— J.P. Murrieta (@KOBSports) November 29, 2014While it's not a complete shock that colleges outside the state aren't beating down the doors of the Bruere residence, the fact that in-state programs New Mexico and New Mexico State have shunned the state's most prolific prep passer is peculiar.For the record, the Lobos received a commitment from 3-star JUCO passer Austin Apodaca in December. The Aggies have yet to secure a verbal pledge from a quarterback in the 2015 cycle, perhaps due to the fact they signed six quarterbacks in the 2014 cycle.\"It baffles me that the home schools don't even offer him, and they're 20 minutes down the road,\" Darlington said.As fate would have it, both schools who came to view Easton live in the spring were heavily interested in him.In fact, the coach from Tulsa hinted to staff members at Rio Rancho that an offer would be coming—one that Carl said Easton was prepared to accept.Their long journey would finally have a happy ending.Instead, a bitter dose of reality intervened.\"It was a Monday when he (Tulsa coach) was here. I guess they saw someone else later that week that they liked better and reneged on that, which was kind of disappointing because we let the cat out and said that Easton was going to commit because he loved Tulsa. That was kind of heartbreaking.\"He was on the Cyclones board as well, but they secured a commitment from their top target, which ended their pursuit of him.The same could be said for Michigan State, where Easton enjoyed working with Spartans quarterback coach Brad Salem during a summer camp session.\"He's a great guy,\" Carl said. \"He already had his offer for 2015, but we had a great experience going there. He was high on Easton, and he still keeps in touch with him.\"RT this: #recruitEastonBruere— Kyle Henderson (@nmpreps) November 29, 2014Despite the disappointments piling up heading into the season, Easton hasn't let the uncertainty surrounding his future affect him whether on or off the field.Instead, he brushed it aside and delivered a nearly flawless senior campaign on the field.He was a solid starter in each of his sophomore and junior seasons but elevated his game to another level as a senior.Entering this season, he had thrown 59 touchdown passes in the previous two seasons while completing nearly 67 percent of his passes. This year, he nearly doubled his total in scoring strikes and raised his completion rate to an astounding 75 percent. Henderson notes that Rio Rancho had never won a state title prior to this season despite being on the cusp of that elusive championship for many years. Easton focused his attention on accomplishing that goal and had to topple Gentry and Mayfield's Kavika Johnson—a quarterback with offers from BYU, UTEP, New Mexico and New Mexico State—to do it. \"Since he didn't get recruited and since he doesn't have any offers, it was almost like he had a chip on his shoulder, and he went out there every game like he had something to prove,\" Henderson said. \"He carried that with him, and I think it elevated his game. They went through a gauntlet in the playoffs and beat a very good team in the state title game.\"However, Easton admits it's been hard to keep a positive attitude at times given his recruitment struggles.\"It gets to me at times,\" Easton said. \"That's just laying in bed at night sometimes and thinking about it. I was able to play for a unique group this year. I spent a ton of time with them, and that kept my mind off recruiting, because we were always just having a ball playing football.\"His attitude in dealing with the snub from colleges reminds Carl of how his son puts away his mistakes on the field—one of the attributes he said helps Easton stand out in a loaded 2015 class of quarterbacks.\"It's funny, because he's amazing in how he's handling all of this,\" Carl said. \"All he says is, 'Dad, I want to go where someone wants me.' That's all he cares about. 'I don't care where it is, as long as they want me and I can help them win.' He just wants to go to a place that wants him there. I don't know how he does it. Because it's killing his father.\" Only a handful of prep football players are fortunate enough to earn scholarship offers to continue their careers in college. There's nothing in Easton Bruere's resume that suggests he shouldn't be one of them.In fact, his body of work suggests he's the nation's most accomplished player in the 2015 class without a scholarship offer.\"In New Mexico, we don't get a lot of notoriety for our football prospects,\" Henderson said. \"We get it. But for someone to put a 13-0 season together at the highest level, with his numbers, that's something noteworthy. There has to be some place out there, Division I-wise, that you'd think this guy can fit into. There's few guys nationally, whether you're from New Mexico or California or Texas, that can say they did what Easton did. He's incredibly deserving of landing a scholarship offer.\" Sanjay Kirpalani is a National Recruiting Analyst for Bleacher Report.

(Courtesy of Matthew Farber)By Matthew FarberThanks in part to STEM education initiatives and the tech boom, coding in the classroom has become more ubiquitous. Computer programming tasks students to persistently work to solve problems by thinking logically. What’s more, learning how to code is a desired 21st century career skill.There are several digital games designed for kids as young as 5 that turn coding into a fun activity, such as Kodable and Scratch Jr. But some game designers are going further back to programming’s fundamentals by creating physical games that can’t be found in any app store.One tabletop game is Code Monkey Island. It features sequencing and looping statements printed on playable cards. In effect, the cards are the language; choosing correct conditional statements correctly can leads to victory.Another board game that captured imaginations, and major crowdfunding on Kickstarter, is Robot Turtles, which teaches basic coding concepts to preschoolers. Unlike other children’s games (think: Candyland, Chutes and Ladders), the mechanic of play does not rely on luck. All cards are face up and the players work together cooperatively to win.A child can build cognitive skills by playing Robot Turtles because when a child plays, or “programs,” a card, he or she is applying logic, according to Bill Ritchie, CEO of ThinkFun, which published the game. “Robot Turtles is a great example of what coding means for a preschooler,” Ritchie explained. “It is about sequencing instruction by instruction, and then being able to recognize the consequences. It’s a mental framework that is appropriate for a preschooler.” In other words, Robot Turtles helps growing minds think about thinking.Why Teach Coding?Teaching children how to code is not new; it dates back to the 1970s and 1980s. Most notable, perhaps, are the initiatives from MIT professor Seymour Papert. His MIT lab helped bring the Logo language into schools. In Logo, users programmed a graphical turtle on a computer’s screen. This exemplified Papert’s notion of constructionism, the learning theory that can be summed up as “learn by making.”Although the Logo language may seem crude by today’s standards, its powerful ideas still resonate. Programming a computer meant that the learner created his or her own working system. Students were learning how to think. In fact, the Logo initiative lives on — it evolved to the visual, interlocking brick language today called Scratch, which was followed up with Scratch Jr.Setting up the GameFlickr/Buster BensonTo start the game, the adult (parent or teacher) — known as the “Turtle Mover” — places the Robot Turtle Card at the start square and then places the Jewel Card (the goal of the turtle’s quest) elsewhere on the board. The Turtle Mover is the only one allowed to move the turtle. He or she also provides feedback by making beeping sounds. The child — or “Turtle Master” — then selects forward, left or right directional playing cards, which serve as commands to advance the turtle to the jewel.When a child wins — or “levels up” — in Robot Turtles, additional challenges “unlock.” Obstacles include stone and ice walls, as well as wooden crates. More complex game cards include Function Frogs, which can be “coded” to repeat a series of programmed instructions. In essence, the adult is the computer to the child programmer.Solving Problems TogetherEntrepreneur Dan Shapiro invented Robot Turtles because he grew frustrated whenever he played board games, along with his two young children. “One of the things that led to Robot Turtles was because [children’s] games give parents an unfair advantage,” Shapiro said. “Either the parent wins over and over again or they end up throwing the match. Part of the inspiration for Robot Turtles was to create a game where parents and kids could come to it at their own level; the parents do one thing and the kids do a different thing.”Meaningful social cooperation between parent and child superseded Shapiro’s desire to teach coding skills. “The interaction would be something really magical,” he continued. “It [Robot Turtles’ creation] didn’t come about because I wanted to teach kids to program; it came about because I wanted a fun way for kids and parents to interact.”Any programmer will tell you that coding a computer is more than entering lines of instructions. When a programmer clicks “run,” the results may fail. The next step is “debugging” — the often painstaking process of error-checking code. Debugging until a solution is found is similar to the 21st century competency of design thinking: trial1360and error based on a challenge.In Robot Turtles, when the child gives an adult a “wrong” card — for example, a move that takes the turtle off of the game’s board — an opportunity to learn emerges. Ritchie explained, “If a child puts down a bad set of cards, then the parent has an obligation to allow the child to own the responsibility. The child then has to make the decision to debug and to change.”Rather than correcting a child’s mistake, the adult is instructed to simply make a beeping sound. The child Turtle Master can then tap on the “Bug Card,” a round card adorned with a ladybug. After announcing “Debug,” the child can adjust his or her set of commands. Here, failure becomes iteration.“If you ask me the one thing I want my kids to feel about learning, it is that you cannot be afraid to try things and see what happens,” Shapiro said. “It was crucial for me to build that [debugging] into the game — more than the skill of learning about computers. The ability to undo the last move — with no penalty or loss of points — where you just try something and then try again, really gets into the heart of the educational mission of the game. It’s not about learning how to program. It’s about learning how to learn.”Explore: board games, coding, game-based learning, programmingPrintTweetEmail PostPrevious Article« More Colleges Offer Competency-Based Degree ProgramsNext ArticleWhy Even ‘Good’ Schools Benefit From Trying Fresh Ideas »581Brian SilberbergVery cool idea, in my experience with teaching coding it could often run into roadbumps if kids found the idea tedious and boring. But making it into a game there is some potential to get the kids of that persuasion interested in the process. Would be hugely interested in seeing how effective this turns out to be down the line.JessaGreat idea, I love seeing interesting ways of teaching coding to kids. I work at UCode where we teach kids after school at our center & on1dline virtually how to code.

We don’t know what started it yet but it’s the D-League where everybody gets to shoot and score. 124-120 final score actually seems low compared to a lot of the games that go down in the league. On Saturday, Reno beat LA 155-147 and last week Reno lost to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers 153-160! Like I said, there’s plenty of shots to go around.Lucas left the game with 18 points, 5 boards and 5 assists while Stokes had 16 points and 8 rebounds. If Stokes sounds familiar it’s because he played with the Grizzlies earlier in the season.Hearing about this story reminded me of when ex-NBA player Renaldo Balkman choked one of his own teammates during a game.I think the closest thing to teammates fighting in the NBA is LeBron blowing up at Chalmers.

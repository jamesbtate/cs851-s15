3078 URIs were boilerpiped successfully in Q3 (representation obtained in Q1)
2865 URIs were dereferenced and boilerpiped successfully in Q4
    started with 3034 URIs
        accidentally excluded some URIs. oh well
    146 dereference errors were skipped

    there was some # on the end

jtate@sirius:~/cs751/hw$ ./count_mementos.py | wc -l
1020
jtate@sirius:~/cs751/hw$ grep /timemaps\$ tweets2_file_list | wc -l
2735
there were 2735-1020=1715 URIs with no mementos

jtate@sirius:~/cs751/hw$ wc -l two-year-old_ids twenty-plus_mementos old_with_20_ids
  373 two-year-old_ids
  134 twenty-plus_mementos
   58 old_with_20_ids
  565 total

had to implement workaround for broken archiveit timemaps that do not include 'http:' in URIs:
    if mementoURI[:2] == '//':
        mementoURI = 'http:' + mementoURI
archiveit also lists mementos with the same time and content for two different URIs:
    www.hostname.tld and hostname.tld
